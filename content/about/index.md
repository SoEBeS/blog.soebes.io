My name is Karl Heinz Marbaise and I am a [Java Champion](https://javachampions.org/members.html),
[Apache Maven Project PMC Member](https://maven.apache.org/team.html), 
[Apache Software Foundation Member](https://people.apache.org/phonebook.html?uid=khmarbaise), [Mojo Haus Member](https://www.mojohaus.org/team.html), 

Java Developer, CI / CD Fan, and working as a Freelancer.

I started programming ca. 1980 while I got in contact with BASIC programming on a 
[PET 2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET). After a time it became to slow 
and I changed to use assembly language ([6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502#Example_code)).

Afterwards I started studying electrical engineering at the [University of Applied Science](https://www.fh-aachen.de/en/) 
(specializing in communications engineering)  and started working as a student assistant and implemented different
things in different assembly languages like [6502](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502), 
[80286](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80286) at that time under [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS).
Also worked with a lot of other things like [Turbo Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) 3.0, up-to Borland Pascal 6.0.

I continued with more assembly programming on [Z80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80),
and got into [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) and got first contacts with version control 
systems like [RCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System). Also got first contacts with DECnet, [VAX 4000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAXstation)
workstations and [VT100](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100)/[VT420](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT420) terminals. Over the time I learned [Word Perfect on MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPerfect).
Also got more in contact with versions control tools like [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System).

Now started to use [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), with different compilers like [Borland C++ 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borland_C%2B%2B),
MicroData C++ Compiler etc. Learned [Bison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Bison), [Flex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flex_(lexical_analyser_generator)), and
worked on [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2), [OS/9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-9), different communications protocols like 
[V24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232), [RS-485](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-485), [3964R protocol](https://doc.ipesoft.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=17282514),

I continued with a lot of assembly programming, C, C++ and started with object-oriented programming with 
[Turbo Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision), [dBase database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBase), 
and implemented measurements with ultrasonic sensors also get in contact with
[Novell Netware 3.12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetWare#NetWare_3.x). 

Started to learn using Visual C, working with [Object Pascal (Delphi)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)), [ISDN D-Channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_channel), 
[CAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_ISDN_Application_Programming_Interface) X31 communications, [Visual Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)), 
[Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT) etc. There I started to learn things about [Windows NT 3.51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.51).

Worked on an implementation of a basic like language while using [GNU-Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)#Derivatives),
[TeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX)/[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX), Flex, Bison etc.
[Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) etc.

I continued my career after graduating and continued to work with VBA, Rexx(OS/2), RCS, CVS, 
[PHP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP), [ClearCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase), and
got in contact with [Subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion) the first time. Also got working
with more databases like PostGreSQL, MySQL etc. Started to work with PHP using a framework like phpmvc (a bit like Java Struts).

In 2004/2005 I continued my work with PHP ([PHPDocumentor](https://phpdoc.org/)) and got more involvement with Java
to do testing of a SOAP interface and started to use Java for that. Enhanced my knowledge of using version control
systems(CVS) to decouple development and deployment. Started to use things like J2EE, JWebUnit, HTTPUnit, JavaDoc,
Hibernate(first versions with Generics) etc. During that time we have migrated from PHP to Java.

I kept working in Java area and used [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) for building the software. 
Also using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit4/), [JUnit Jupiter](https://https://junit.org/junit5/), 
[TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/), [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), [AssertJ](https://assertj.github.io/doc/),
[Testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) to write unit- integration and end-to-end tests. Checking via [JaCoCo (code overage)](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/)
and [mutation testing (pitest)](https://pitest.org/) and checking things via [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/).
Also using security check tools like oss-index/owasp or alike.

All over that time I have always interacted with setting up the infrastructure for automatic building the software
for example via CruiseControl, Continuum, Hudson, [Jenkins](https://jenins.io), [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository),
SonarQube, [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Gitea](https://gitea.io), etc. Also used [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org) 
for branching/merging. Also got entries in frameworks like Hibernate, [Quartz](https://github.com/quartz-scheduler/quartz), 
[Spring](https://spring.io), [Axis2](https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/),

I got more and more involved with [Mojo Haus Plugins](https://www.mojohaus.org/), because I had found a number of bugs.
I got the chance to provide a number of patches and being invited to become a committer on Mojo Haus (former Codehaus). 
This continued to the time being invited to become an Apache Maven committer and continued with invitation to become an 
Apache Software Foundation Member and finally become the Apache Maven Chairman.

I've done a lot of trainings (Git, Maven, Jenkins, Nexus, CI/CD consultancy and other things) over the time and 
also made lectures on different conferences like BaselOne, JAX, FOSDEM, CyberJug, UGDarmstadt etc.

I've started with a few [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@khmarbaise) about Apache Maven
and Junit Jupiter.
