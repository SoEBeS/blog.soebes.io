The MojoHaus Team is pleased to announce of the
[Properties Maven Plugin Version 1.0.0](http://www.mojohaus.org/properties-maven-plugin/).

The Properties Maven Plugin is here to make life a little easier when dealing
with properties. It provides goals to read properties from files and URLs and
write properties to files, and also to set system properties.

You should specify the version in your projects dependencies:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
  <artifactId>properties-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</plugin>
```
