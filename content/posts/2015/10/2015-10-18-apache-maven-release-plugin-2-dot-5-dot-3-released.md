The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven Release, version 2.5.3](http://maven.apache.org/maven-release/).

This plugin is used to release a project with Maven, saving a lot of
repetitive, manual work. Releasing a project is made in two steps: prepare and
perform.

You should specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>2.5.3</version>
</plugin>
```
