The Mojo team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[buildnumber-maven-plugin version 1.3](http://mojo.codehaus.org/buildnumber-maven-plugin/).

This mojo is designed to get a unique build number for each time you build your project. 
So while your version may remain constant at 1.0-SNAPSHOT for many iterations until release, 
you will have a build number that can uniquely identify each build during that time.

To get this update, simply specify the version in your project's plugin configuration:

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
  <artifactId>buildnumber-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.3</version>
</plugin>
```
