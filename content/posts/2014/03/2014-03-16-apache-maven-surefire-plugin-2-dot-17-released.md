The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of the 
[Apache Maven Surefire Plugin, version 2.17](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/)

This release comes with some smaller improvements and bug fixes for TestNG,
for the JUnit Parallel Computer, the removal of temporary files, and last
but not least it fixes a compatibility issue with JDK 8 - just in time for
the much anticipated GA this week.
Yet again we received some much appreciated contributions from the
community. Thank you and keep 'em coming!
