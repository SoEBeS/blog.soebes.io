The Apache Maven team is pleased to announce the release of 
the [Apache Maven Filtering, version 1.2](http://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-filtering/)

These Plexus components have been built from the filtering process/code in Apache Maven Resources Plugin.
The goal is to provide a shared component for all plugins that need to filter resources.


You should add the following dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.shared</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-filtering</artifactId>
  <version>1.2</version>
</dependency>
```
